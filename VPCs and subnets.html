	 <h3 style="font-size:150%;color: #767676" align="center">Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)</h3>
	 <p>A VPC is basically a virtually isolated network in the cloud, which resembles a traditional network in a corporate datacenter. Every user can create VPC in their own AWS account. You can create an AWS account by following this link <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">here</a> (Prerequisite)</p>
	 <h4 align="left" style="font-size:125%; color: #767676"><strong>
Subnets<br>
		 
</strong></h4>
	 <p>A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.</p>

<p>When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16. This is the primary CIDR block for your VPC.</p>
<p>A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region. After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block. Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. We assign a unique ID to each subnet.
	 </p><p>You can also optionally assign an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC, and assign IPv6 CIDR blocks to your subnets.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows a VPC that has been configured with subnets in multiple Availability Zones. 1A, 1B, 2A, and 3A are instances in your VPC. An IPv6 CIDR block is associated with the VPC, and an IPv6 CIDR block is associated with subnet 1. An internet gateway enables communication over the internet, and a virtual private network (VPN) connection enables communication with your corporate network.
</p>

	 <p>If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a <strong>public subnet</strong>. In this diagram, <strong>subnet 1</strong> is a public subnet. If you want your instance in a public subnet to communicate with the internet over IPv4, it must have a public IPv4 address or an Elastic IP address (IPv4). If you want your instance in the public subnet to communicate with the internet over IPv6, it must have an IPv6 address.</p>
	 <p>If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, the subnet is known as a <strong>private subnet</strong>. In this diagram, <strong>subnet 2</strong> is a private subnet.</p>
	 <p>If a subnet doesn't have a route to the internet gateway, but has its traffic routed to a virtual private gateway for a Site-to-Site VPN connection, the subnet is known as a <strong>VPN-only subnet</strong>. In this diagram, <strong>subnet 3</strong> is a VPN-only subnet. Currently, we do not support IPv6 traffic over a Site-to-Site VPN connection.</p>
	 <p>Regardless of the type of subnet, the internal IPv4 address range of the subnet is always private—we do not announce the address block to the internet.</p>
	 <p>There is a limit to the number of VPCs and subnets one can create in for a particular account.</p>
	 <h3 align="left" style="font-size:125%; color: #767676">Classless Inter-domain Routing(CIDR): </h3>
	 <p>For choosing a VPC and creating its subnets, you need to select the range of private IP addresses in the VPC and its subnets. This IP range will be further allocated to all the resources inside this VPC, the range is called CIDR.</p>
	 <p>Consider a CIDR IPv4 range 10.0.0.0/16, a VPC can have a range of /16 to /28 for the netmask(specification of the number of address bits available in a network).</p>
	 <p>Here /16 will allocate 65536 IPv4 addresses in VPC using the calculation given below:<br>
As IPv4 represents 32 bit addressing, 32-16(n)= 16  2^16 (2 raised to power 16) = 65536. 
In any given VPC, 5 IP addresses are reserved by AWS. In the above VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, the following are reserved by AWS. 
</p>
	 <ul>
	 <li>10.0.0.0: Network address.</li>
	 <li>10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.</li>
	 <li>10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS for DNS</li>
	 <li>10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.</li>
	 <li>10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address- Broadcast is not supported in VPC but, AWS reserves this IP address.</li></ul>
	 
	 <h3 align="left" style="font-size:125%; color: #767676">Subnet Sizing</h3>
	 <p>Amazon VPC supports IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, and has different CIDR block size limits for each. By default, all VPCs and subnets must have IPv4 CIDR blocks—you can't change this behavior. You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC.</p>
	 <h3 align="left" style="font-size:125%; color: #767676">Let us understand this with a different analogy:</h3>
	 <p>Think of your office as a multi-story building
Each floor has multiple suites
Each department like HR, Payroll can sit in one floor (or) multiple floors
Every suite has few rooms
Each room has couple of desk where employees work
</p>
	 <p><strong>Region:</strong>  Think of the office building as equal to a Region. Just like how AWS Regions encompass other components, the office building is an outer layer that contains many things.</p>
	 <p><strong>Availability Zone:</strong> Think of each floor like an Availability Zone. Just like a region can have more than one availability zone, our building can have more than one floor.</p>
	 <p><strong>VPC:</strong>  Each department in the office is like a VPC. VPCs span across availability zones in a region, and each department in your office can span across different floors.</p>
	 <p><strong>Subnet:</strong>  Each Suite represents a subnet. Like how each subnet resides ONLY within an availability zone, each suite will be part of the floor and it won’t span across floors.</p>
	 <p><strong>IP Address:</strong>  Each desk within a suite represents an IP address.</p>
	 <p>When companies assign a desk to employee, they first look at:
Which department this employee belongs to
Then identifies which floors the department spans across
Then identifies which suites have open desks
Assigns one of the open desks to the employee
</p>
	 <p><strong>Likewise, when anyone launch AWS EC2 instance:</strong></p>
	 <p>We need to pick which VPC this instance should be deployed to
Then we pick which availability zone (if not, default availability zone)
Then we pick the subnet (if not default subnet)   
Then an IP from this subnet gets assigned to our EC2 instance (as private IP)
